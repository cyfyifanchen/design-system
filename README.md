# Share Design System

This is Share Design System that I built for fun, it was built on Vercel's Turbopack meaning to show the ability of combing various technologies together if you happen to have different front end teams that used different techs.

## Share design system across React, Vue, Qwik and Solid

Cut to the chase, a single line of code change that does the global header update across all teams, in short, it makes life easier.

hmm, where do I start? Okay, I built this project initially for a showcase that implementing BFF for FED. Now I kinda want to use it for other purpose.

What if I try to rewrite it in Rust? That'd be cool.
